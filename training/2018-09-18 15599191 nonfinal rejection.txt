Art Unit: 2842

1. The present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being examined under the

first inventor to file provisions of the AIA.

DETAILED ACTION
2. Non-final communication in response to communication filed 9/4/18.
Election/Restrictions
3. Applicant’s election without traverse of species I, figures 1-13, claims 1-10, 16-20 in the

reply filed on 9/4/18 is acknowledged.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
4. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that form the
basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(a)(1) the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale or
otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.

(a)(2) the claimed invention was described in a patent issued under section 151, or in an application for
patent published or deemed published under section 122(b), in which the patent or application, as the
case may be, names another inventor and was effectively filed before the effective filing date of the
claimed invention.

5. Claim(s) 1,2,9,10,16-20 is/are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) as being anticipated by
Jung 9443565.

With respect to claim | figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose a delay locked loop comprising:
a delay line [124] configured to delay an input clock signal [DCLK] in units of unit delay in
response to a delay control code [SELn] to generate an output clock signal [OCLK];
a delay circuit [136,134] configured to delay the output clock signal to generate a delay clock

signal [FCLK];Application/Control Number: 15/599,191 Page 3
Art Unit: 2842

a phase detector [130] configured to compare the input clock signal and the delay clock signal to
generate a phase detection signal [UP/DN];

a delay code generator [150] configured to compare the input clock signal and the delay clock
signal to detect a phase difference there between and generate a delay code [CONS] using the
phase difference; and

a delay controller [133] configured to generate the delay control code using the delay code and
the phase detection signal.

With respect to claim 2 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose the delay locked loop of claim 1,
wherein the delay code generator maintains the delay code, generated using a first cycle of the
input clock signal, during a locking process of the delay locked loop.

With respect to claim 9 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose the delay locked loop of claim 1,
wherein the delay controller generates an initial delay control code using the delay code and
shifts the initial delay control code in response to the phase detection signal to generate the delay
control code.

With respect to claim 10 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose the delay locked loop of claim
1, wherein the delay code and the delay control code are initialized by a reset signal. [col. 8, lines
61-67].

With respect to claim 16 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose a method of performing a
coarse lock process using a delay locked loop [fig. 6], the method comprising:
receiving, at a phase detector [130], an input clock signal [DCLK] and a delay clock signal
[FCLK], wherein the delay clock signal is an output clock signal [OCLK] of the delay locked

loop that is delayed for a predetermined amount of time [134,136];Application/Control Number: 15/599,191 Page 4
Art Unit: 2842

determining, by the phase detector, a phase difference between the input clock signal and the
delay clock signal to generate a phase detection signal [UP/DN];

receiving, at a delay code generator [150], the input clock signal and the delay clock signal;
generating, by the delay code generator, a delay code [CONS] using the input clock signal and
the delay clock signal;

receiving, at a delay controller [133], the phase detection signal and the delay code;
generating, by the delay controller, a delay control code [SELn] using the phase detection code
and the delay code; and

receiving, at a delay line [124], the input clock signal and the delay control code to generate the
output clock signal.

With respect to claim 17 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose the method of claim 16, wherein
in a first cycle of the input clock signal, the delay code generator generates an initial delay code,
and after the first cycle, the initial delay code is maintained.

With respect to claim 18 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose the method of claim 16, wherein
the delay locked loop performs a first loop and a second loop,
the first loop includes receiving the phase detection signal and the delay code at the delay
controller and generating the delay control code, and
the second loop includes receiving the input clock signal and the delay clock signal at the delay
code generator and generating the delay code.

With respect to claim 19 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose the method of claim 16, further
comprising:
comparing, by the phase detector, the input clock signal with the delay clock signal to determine

that the delay locked loop is coarse-locked; andApplication/Control Number: 15/599,191 Page 5
Art Unit: 2842

completing the coarse lock process by generating a coarse lock signal. [figure 5 shows coarse
lock step]

With respect to claim 20 figures 6 and 7 of Jung disclose the method of claim 16, further
comprising:
comparing, by the phase detector, the input clock signal with the delay clock signal to determine
that the delay locked loop is not coarse-locked;
generating the phase detection signal using the input clock signal and the delay clock signal,
wherein the phase detection signal is either a code rising signal or a code falling signal
[UP/DN]; and

updating the delay control code using the phase detection signal.

Allowable Subject Matter
6. Claims 3-8 are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would be
allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and

any intervening claims.
