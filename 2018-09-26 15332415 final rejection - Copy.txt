DETAILED ACTION
Notice of Pre-AlA or AIA Status
1. The present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being examined

under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA.

Response to Amendment
2. The amendment filed on 6/5/2018 has been entered, claims 10-19 are withdrawn
from consideration, claims 34-35 are cancelled, and claim 36 is new; thus claims 1-9,

20-33 and 36 are currently pending in this application.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 112
3. The following is a quotation of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112(a):

(a) IN GENERAL.—The specification shall contain a written description of the
invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise,
and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it
is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode
contemplated by the inventor or joint inventor of carrying out the invention.

4, Claim 36 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a), as failing to comply with the written
description requirement. The claim contains subject matter which was not described in
the specification in such a way as to reasonably convey to one skilled in the relevant art
that the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AlA the inventor(s), at the time the
application was filed, had possession of the claimed invention.

Specifically, the limitation wherein: “the second organic material layer includes an
overlapping portion and a step portion outside the overlapping portion” and “an upper

surface of the second organic material layer in the step portion is substantially parallelApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 3
Art Unit: 2892

to an upper surface of the inorganic insulating layer,” are considered as new matter
because the specification and Fig. 3B of the instant application do not have support for
the second organic material layer including both an overlapping portion and a step
portion outside the overlapping portion. Also, an upper surface of the second organic
material layer in the step portion does not have any portion that is substantially parallel
to an upper surface of the inorganic insulating layer. The second organic material layer
does not have an upper surface or any surface at all in the step section.

It is the first organic material layer that indeed has an overlapping portion and a
step portion outside the overlapping portion as well as an upper surface of the first
organic material layer in the step portion is substantially parallel to an upper surface of

the inorganic insulating layer.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
5. In the event the determination of the status of the application as subject to AIA 35
U.S.C. 102 and 103 (or as subject to pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103) is incorrect, any
correction of the statutory basis for the rejection will not be considered a new ground of
rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the rejection, would be
the same under either status.
6. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:
A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —
(a)(1) the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use,

on sale or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed
invention.Application/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 4
Art Unit: 2892

7. Claims 1-9, 24-25, 27 and 29 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) as being

anticipated by Fujiyoshi et al. US PGPub. 2015/0380679 of record.

Regarding claim 1, Fujiyoshi teaches a display apparatus (fig. 1-5 and 13)
comprising:

a substrate (10, fig. 5 and 13) [0028] comprising a first area (S1, fig. 5 and 13)
[0029], a second area (S2/S3, fig. 5 and 13) [0029], and a bending area (C, fig. 5 and
13) [0029] located between the first area (S1) and the second area (S2), the bending
area (C ) configured to be bent (see fig. 2) about a first bending axis (see fig. 3)
extending in a first direction (from front to back, hereinafter F-B, see second and third
dotted lines on fig. 4);

an inorganic insulating layer (111, fig. 5 and 13) [0063] arranged over the
substrate (10);

a first conductive layer (114, fig. 13) [0053] extending from the first area (S1)
to the second area (S2) passing over the bending area (C ) and arranged over the
inorganic insulating layer (111); and

an organic material layer (50, fig. 5 and 13) [0053] arranged between the
inorganic insulating layer (111) and the first conductive layer (114) (see fig. 13),
contacting (indirect contact, fig, 13) the inorganic insulating layer (111), and comprising
a central portion (50-C; see examiner's fig. 1) and a peripheral portion (50-P; see
examiner’s fig. 1),

wherein the central portion (50-C) overlaps with the bending area (C ),

the peripheral portion (50-P) extends from the central portion (50-C), andApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 5
Art Unit: 2892

an average thickness of the central portion (50-C) is greater than (see
examiner's fig. 1) an average thickness of the peripheral portion (50-P) (Fujiyoshi et al.,
fig. 15 and 13).

Fig. 13 is the embodiment chosen for the rejection and the portion of fig. 13 is
substituted for the middle portion/middle pair of squiggly lines of fig. 5.

In order to overcome the current grounds of rejection, the claim must recite that
the organic material layer is in direct contact with the inorganic insulating layer because
using the broadest reasonable interpretation, “contact” can include intervening layers
while “direct contact” cannot include intervening layers.

Regarding claim 2, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, wherein
the inorganic insulating layer (111) has a flat upper surface (see fig. 13) at an area (C,
fig. 13) overlapping with the organic material layer (50) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 13).

Regarding claim 3, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, wherein

the central portion (50-C) has a substantially uniform thickness (see examiner’s fig. 1)Application/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 6
Art Unit: 2892

(Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 13).

Alternatively, regarding claim 1, Fujiyoshi teaches a display apparatus (fig. 1-
5 and 13)
comprising:

a substrate (10, fig. 5 and 13) [0028] comprising a first area (S1, fig. 5 and 13)
[0029], a second area (S2/S3, fig. 5 and 13) [0029], and a bending area (C, fig. 5 and
13) [0029] located between the first area (S1) and the second area (S2), the bending
area (C ) configured to be bent (see fig. 2) about a first bending axis (see fig. 3)
extending in a first direction (from front to back, hereinafter F-B, see second and third
dotted lines on fig. 4);

an inorganic insulating layer (111, fig. 5 and 13) [0063] arranged over the
substrate (10);

a first conductive layer (114, fig. 13) [0053] extending from the first area (S1)
to the second area (S2) passing over the bending area (C ) and arranged over the
inorganic insulating layer (111); and

an organic material layer (50, fig. 5 and 13) [0053] arranged between the
inorganic insulating layer (111) and the first conductive layer (114) (see fig. 13),
contacting (indirect contact, fig, 13) the inorganic insulating layer (111), and comprising
a central portion (50-C; see examiner's fig. 2) and a peripheral portion (50-P; see
examiner's fig. 2),

wherein the central portion (50-C) overlaps with the bending area (C ),

the peripheral portion (50-P) extends from the central portion (50-C), and

an average thickness of the central portion (50-C) is greater than (seeApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 7
Art Unit: 2892

examiner's fig. 2) an average thickness of the peripheral portion (50-P) (Fujiyoshi et al.,
fig. 15 and 13).

Fig. 13 is the embodiment chosen for the rejection and the portion of fig. 13 is
substituted for the middle portion/middle pair of squiggly lines of fig. 5.

Regarding claim 4, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, wherein
the peripheral portion (50-P) comprises an area having a substantially uniform thickness
(see examiner's fig. 2), and a thickness of the peripheral portion (see examiner's fig. 2)
decreases in a direction away from the central portion (see examiner's fig. 2) (Fujiyoshi
et al., fig. 13).

Regarding claim 5, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1,
wherein a thickness of the peripheral portion (50-P) gradually decreases in a direction
away from the central portion (50-C) (see examiner's fig. 1) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 13).

Regarding claim 6, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1,Application/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 8
Art Unit: 2892

wherein the organic material (50) layer comprises: a first organic material layer (bottom
half portion of 50; hereinafter 50-1, see examiner's fig. 3); and a second organic
material layer (top half portion of 50; hereinafter 50-2, see examiner’s fig. 3) arranged
on the first organic material layer (50-1), wherein the first organic material layer (50-1)
has a first width (hereinafter W-1, see examiner's fig. 3), the second organic material
layer (50-2) has a second width (hereinafter W-2, see examiner’s fig. 3) smaller than the
first width (W-1) , the second width (W-2) is greater than a width of the bending area (C

) (examiner’s fig. 3) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 13).

Regarding claim 7, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, wherein
the organic material layer (50) has an uneven surface at least partially in an upper
surface of the organic material layer (50) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 13).

At least a portions of top portion of the organic layer (50) are curved andApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 9
Art Unit: 2892

hence uneven. Uneven is interpreted as not being straight or parallel or level. As can be
seen from fig. 13, only the center portion of the top surface the organic layer (50) is
straight, the other portions on the periphery have a curved/uneven surface.

Regarding claim 8, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 7, wherein
the organic material layer (50) has the uneven surface (curved and not straight) in the
central portion (portion overlapping C, see fig. 4) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 4). When the
display is in a curved state as seen in fig. 4, the bent portion is curved and therefore the
central portion organic material layer (50) which overlaps the bent portion will also be
curved/bent and therefore uneven.

Regarding claim 9, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 7,
wherein an upper surface (top surface) of the first conductive layer (114) over the
organic material layer (50) has a shape corresponding to a shape of the upper surface
(top surface) of the organic material layer (50).

Regarding claim 24, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, further
comprising: a thin film transistor (TFT) (110, fig. 5) [0052] arranged over the first area
($1) or the second area and comprising a source electrode [0064], a drain electrode
[0064], and a gate electrode [0064]; and

a planarization layer (151, fig. 5) [0053] covering the TFT (10) and comprising
an organic material [0053], wherein the organic material layer (50) comprises
substantially the same material as that of the planarization layer (151) (see fig. 13,
[0056]) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 5 and 13).

Regarding claim 25, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, further

comprising: an organic light-emitting device (OLED, fig. 5) [0054] arranged over the firstApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 10
Art Unit: 2892

area (S1) and comprising a pixel electrode (114, fig. 5) [0053], an opposite electrode
(translucent electrode, not shown in fig. 5, [0054]) facing the pixel electrode (114), and
an intermediate layer (120, fig. 5) [0054] comprising an organic emission layer (120)
and arranged between the pixel electrode (114) and the opposite electrode (translucent
electrode [0054]; and

a pixel defining layer (153, fig. 5) [0053] arranged over the first area (S1), the
pixel defining layer (153) having an opening that exposes a center portion (see fig. 5) of
the pixel electrode (114) and defines a pixel area (portion of display region D1 between
right edge of 153 and squiggly line, fig. 5), wherein the organic material layer (50)
comprises substantially the same material (organic material, [0053] and [0068]) as that
of the pixel defining layer (153) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 5 and 13).

The light emitting layer 120 of the OLED is considered as an organic emission
layer because the light emitting layer is of an organic light emitting device (OLELD) and
an OLED necessarily used an organic material for the light emitting layer hence the
name organic light emitting device (OLED). Other light emitting layers, not of organic
materials, are simply LEDs.

Regarding claim 27, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, further
comprising a second conductive layer (112, fig. 5 and 13) arranged over the first area
(S1) or the second area (S2), wherein the second conductive layer (112) is located on a
layer (located directly in contact with layer 111, fig. 5 and 13) different from a layer
(located directly in contact with layer 112 and 50, fig. 5 and 13) on which the first
conductive layer (114) is located, and the second conductive layer (112) is electrically

connected (both electrically conductive in direct contact with each other, fig. 5) to theApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 11
Art Unit: 2892

first conductive layer (114) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 5 and 13).

Regarding claim 29, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 27,
further comprising a TFT (110, fig. 5) [0052] arranged over the first area (S1) or the
second area and comprising a source electrode [0064], a drain electrode [0064], anda
gate electrode [0064], wherein the first conductive layer (114) is on a same layer
(indirectly on the same substrate (10)) as the source electrode ([0064], see fig. 5) and
the drain electrode ([0064], see fig. 5), and the second conductive layer (112) is ona
same layer (indirectly on the same substrate (10)) as the gate electrode ([0064], see fig.
5) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 5).

All the layers, source, drain, gate, first (114) and second conductive (112)
layers are all on the same substrate (10) albeit all in indirect contact with the substrate
(10). The claims must specifically recite that the second conductive layer is in direct
contact with the same layer that the gate electrode is in direct contact with, in order to

overcome the examiner's interpretation of "on the same layer."

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
8. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed
invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences
between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole
would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person
having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not
be negated by the manner in which the invention was made.

9. This application currently names joint inventors. In considering patentability of the

claims the examiner presumes that the subject matter of the various claims wasApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 12
Art Unit: 2892

commonly owned as of the effective filing date of the claimed invention(s) absent any
evidence to the contrary. Applicant is advised of the obligation under 37 CFR 1.56 to
point out the inventor and effective filing dates of each claim that was not commonly
owned as of the effective filing date of the later invention in order for the examiner to
consider the applicability of 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C) for any potential 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)

prior art against the later invention.

10. Claims 20-21 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over
Fujiyoshi et al. US PGPub. 2015/0380679 as applied to claim 1 above, and further

in view of Cheng US PGPub. 2017/0250237, all of record.

Regarding claim 20, Fujiyoshi does not teach the display apparatus of claim 1,
further comprising: a protective film disposed on a lower surface of the substrate (10),
wherein the lower surface is opposite a surface of the substrate nearest to the inorganic
insulating layer, and the protective film comprises an opening corresponding to the
bending area.

However, Cheng teaches a display apparatus (fig. 1-6) comprising a protective
film (122, fig. 5) [0021] disposed on a lower surface (top surface) of the substrate (102,
fig. 5) [0021], wherein the lower surface is opposite a surface (top surface) of the
substrate (102) nearest to the inorganic insulating layer (144, fig. 5) [0035], and the
protective film (122) comprises an opening (124, fig. 2 and 5) [0021] corresponding to
the bending area (bent portion of 120, fig. 2 and 5) [0020] (Cheng, fig. 2 and 5).

At the time before the effective filing of the invention, it would have been obviousApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 13
Art Unit: 2892

to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine the teaching of Fujiyoshi with the teaching
of Cheng by placing a protective film as taught by Cheng in order to strengthen the
substrate by making it thicker but also controlling the bending of the substrate thereby
allowing the substrate to easily bend at the position of the opening (Cheng, [0021]).
Regarding claim 21, Fujiyoshi in view of Cheng teaches the display apparatus of
claim 20, wherein an area (see examiner's fig. 4) of the opening (124) is larger than an

area (see examiner's fig. 4) of the bending area (bent portion of 120) (Cheng, fig. 5).

11. Claims 22-23 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over
Fujiyoshi et al. US PGPub. 2015/0380679 as applied to claim 1 above, and further

in view of Kwon et al. US PGPub. 2016/0066409, all of record.

Regarding claim 22, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, furtherApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 14
Art Unit: 2892

comprising: an encapsulation layer (170, fig. 5) [0057] covering a display device (OLED,
fig. 5) [0054] over the first area (S1) and the first conductive layer (114) is made of
indium tin oxide material (ITO, [0067]) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 5).

But Fujiyoshi fails to teach a touch electrode configured to provide a touchscreen
and located over the encapsulation layer, wherein the first conductive layer comprises
substantially the same material as that of the touch electrode.

However, Kwon teaches a display device (fig. 1B) comprising an encapsulation
layer (104, fig. 1B) covering a display device (OLED 102, fig. 1B) [0051] over the first
area (center portion, fig. 1B) and a touch electrode (112, fig. 1B) [0063] configured to
provide a touchscreen and located over the encapsulation layer (104), wherein the
touch electrode (112) is made of indium tin oxide material (ITO, [0063]) (Kwon et al., fig.
1B, [0063)).

At the time before the effective filing of the invention, it would have been obvious
to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine the teaching of Fujiyoshi with the teaching
of Kwon by providing touch electrode on the display device in order to provide more
functionalities for the display device such as touch sense or fingerprint identification
functionalities (Kwon et al., [0005)).

Therefore Fujiyoshi in view of Kwon teaches wherein the first conductive layer
(114 of Fujiyoshi) comprises substantially the same material (indium tin oxide) as that of
the touch electrode (112 of Kwon).

Regarding claim 23, Fujiyoshi in view of Kwon teaches the display apparatus of
claim 22, further comprising a touch protective layer (cover layer, 114, fig. 1B) [0067]

covering the touch electrode (112) and the first conductive layer (pixel electrode ofApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 15
Art Unit: 2892

OLED 102) (Kwon et al., fig. 1B).

At the time before the effective filing of the invention, it would have been obvious
to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine the teaching of Fujiyoshi with the teaching
of Kwon by providing a protective layer on the touch electrode in order to protect the

touch electrode and other layer from damage from impurities.

12. Claim 26 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over
Fujiyoshi et al. US PGPub. 2015/0380679 as applied to claim 1 above, and further

in view of Visweswaran et al. US PGPub. 2017/0179432, all of record.

Regarding claim 26, Fujiyoshi teaches the display apparatus of claim 1, further
comprising an encapsulation layer (170, fig. 5) [0057] comprising an organic
encapsulation layer (acrylic resin 170, fig. 5) [0070], wherein the organic material layer
(50) comprises substantially the same material (acrylic resin, [0041]) as that of the
organic encapsulation layer (170) (Fujiyoshi et al., fig. 5, [0041 and 0070)).

But Fujiyoshi fails to teach the encapsulation layer (170) comprising a first
inorganic encapsulation layer, a second inorganic encapsulation layer, and an organic
encapsulation layer between the first inorganic encapsulation layer and the second
inorganic encapsulation layer and covering a display device over the first area.

However, Visweswaran teaches a display apparatus (fig. 7A) comprising an
encapsulation layer (720, fig. 7A) [0060] comprising a first inorganic encapsulation layer
(722, fig. 7A) [0060], a second inorganic encapsulation layer (726, fig. 7A) [0060], and

an organic encapsulation layer (724, fig. 7A) [0060] between the first inorganicApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 16

encapsulation layer (722) and the second inorganic encapsulation layer (726) and
covering a display device (708, fig. 7AO [0059] over the first area (X’, fig. 7A)
(Visweswaran et al., fig. 7A).

At the time before the effective filing of the invention, it would have been obvious
to one of ordinary skill in the art to make the simple substitution of the single layer
encapsulation layer of Fujiyoshi with the multi-layer encapsulation layer as taught by
Visweswaran because an encapsulation layer comprising inorganic and organic
encapsulations layers is well known in the art and such material is art recognized
suitability for the intended purpose of ensuring proper moisture protection of the display

circuitry in the active/display area (Visweswaran et al., [0060]) (see MPEP 2144.07).

13. Claim 28 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over
Fujiyoshi et al. US PGPub. 2015/0380679 as applied to claim 27 above, and further
in view of Honjo US PGPub. 2015/0171113, all of record and as evidenced by

hitos:/ Awww enaginseringtoaibox cam/yoaung-modulus-d 417 jyimi

     

Regarding claim 28, Fujiyoshi does not teach the display apparatus of claim 27,
wherein an elongation rate of the first conductive layer (114) is greater than that of the
second conductive layer (112).

But Fujiyoshi teaches wherein the display the second conductive layer (112) is
made of Al or Ti [0064], the first conductive layer (114) is made of ITO, [0067], and that
the display device can also be a top emission type display apparatus [0054] in which

case the first conductive layer (114) / pixel electrode could be a reflective material.Application/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 17
Art Unit: 2892

With that said, Honjo teaches a display apparatus (Fig. 51) wherein the first
conductive layer/pixel electrode is aluminum [0189] and the second conductive
layer/source/drain electrode is molybdenum [0121] (Honjo, fig. 51, [0121] and [0189)).

At the time before the effective filing of the invention, it would have been obvious
to one of ordinary skill in the art to make the simple substitution of the materials used for
the first conductive layer/pixel electrode and the second conductive layer/source/drain
electrode of Fujiyoshi with the materials used for the first conductive layer/pixel
electrode and the second conductive layer/source/drain electrode of Honjo because
such materials are well known in the art and such substitution is art recognized
equivalence for the same purpose to obtain predictable results such as a display device
where the pixel and source/drain electrodes have excellent conductivity (see MPEP
2144.06).

Also, at the time before the effective filing of the claimed invention, it would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to make the simple substitution of the
materials used for the first conductive layer/pixel electrode and the second conductive
layer/source/drain electrode of Fujiyoshi with the materials used for the first conductive
layer/pixel electrode and the second conductive layer/source/drain electrode of Honjo
because Honjo discloses a finite number of materials to use for the pixel and
source/drain electrode [0121] and [0189]. Therefore, a person of ordinary skill in the art
has a good reason to pursue using aluminum for the pixel electrode for a top emission
type display device and using molybdenum for the source/drain electrode within his or
her technical grasp with a reasonable expectation of success. It has been held that, if

this leads to anticipated success, it is likely that the product or process [was] not ofApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 18

innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that instance the fact that a
combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103.
See MPEP 2143 section (E "Obvious To Try’).

Therefore, with the material substitution of Fujiyoshi with that of Honjo, Fujiyoshi
in view of Honjo will necessarily yield a display apparatus of claim 27, wherein an
elongation rate of the first conductive layer (114/pixel electrode substituted with
aluminum of Honjo) is greater than that of the second conductive layer
(112/source/drain electrode substituted with molybdenum of Honjo) because aluminum
has a young's modulus of ~69GPa while molybdenum has a young's modulus of
~329GPa. A higher young's modulus means a harder/stiffer material and hence a
smaller elongation rate (elasticity) than a material having a smaller young's modulus
which means a softer material and hence a greater elongation rate (elasticity). See

Hips / Awww engineeringtoolbos corm/young-modulus-c 417 html showing the modulus

 

of elasticity/young’s modulus of aluminum and molybdenum.

14. Claim 30 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over
Fujiyoshi et al. US PGPub. 2015/0380679 as applied to claim 1 above, and further

in view of Park et al., US PGPub. 2014/0299884, all of record.

Regarding claim 30, Fujiyoshi does not teach the display apparatus of claim 1,
further comprising a stress neutralization layer arranged over an upper portion of the
first conductive layer (114).

However, Park teaches a display apparatus (Fig. 12-15) comprising a stressApplication/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 19
Art Unit: 2892

neutralization layer (92, fig. 12 and 15) [0057] arranged over an upper portion of the first
conductive layer (80, fig. 12 and 15) [0052] (Park et al., fig. 12 and 15, [0057)).

At the time before the effective filing of the invention, it would have been obvious
to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine the teaching of Fujiyoshi with the teaching
of Park by using a stress neutralizer on the curved portion of the display/on the upper
portion of the first conductive layer in order to balance out the stress of lower the stress
on the first conductive layer even in situations where the display device if bent at a right

angle (Park et al., [0058)).

Allowable Subject Matter
15. Claim 1-9 and 20-33 are allowed.
16. — The following is an examiner’s statement of reasons for allowance: the prior arts
of record taken alone or in combination neither anticipates nor renders obvious the
display apparatus wherein “an upper surface of the inorganic insulating layer and an
upper surface of the peripheral portion of the organic material layer contact, forming an
angle that is less than or equal to 45 degrees,” as recited in claim 31.
17. Claims 32-33 are also allowed for further limiting and depending upon allowed

claim 31.

Any comments considered necessary by applicant must be submitted no later
than the payment of the issue fee and, to avoid processing delays, should preferably
accompany the issue fee. Such submissions should be clearly labeled “Comments on

Statement of Reasons for Allowance.”Application/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 20
Art Unit: 2892

Remarks
18. Claim 36 is also indicated as allowed if the 112(a) rejection can be overcome.
19. The following is an examiner's statement of reasons for indicating allowance: the
prior arts of record taken alone or in combination neither anticipates nor renders
obvious the display apparatus wherein “the second organic material layer includes an
overlapping portion and a step portion outside the overlapping portion” and “an upper
surface of the second organic material layer in the step portion is substantially parallel
to an upper surface of the inorganic insulating layer,” as recited in claim 36.
20. Furthermore, claim 36 will also be allowed if the limitation was amended to read
as: ‘the seeend first organic material layer includes an overlapping portion and a step
portion outside the overlapping portion” and “an upper surface of the seeend first
organic material layer in the step portion is substantially parallel to an upper surface of
the inorganic insulating layer,” which is supported in the specification of instant

application (see fig. 3B) and would overcome the 112(a) rejection.

Response to Arguments
21. — Applicant’s arguments with respect to claims 1-9 and 20-30 have been
considered but are moot because the arguments do not apply to the new interpretation
of the same reference being used in the current rejection as that used in the previous

rejection. See remarks regarding the interpretation of the word “contact.”Application/Control Number: 15/332,415 Page 21
