MEMORY MODULES, MEMORY SYSTEMS INCLUDING THE SAME, AND METHODS

OF CALIBRATING MULTI-DIE IMPEDANCE OF THE MEMORY MODULES

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to Korean Patent Application No.
10-2017-0101408, filed on August 10, 2017 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the

disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept described herein relate to memory
devices, and more particularly, to memory modules, memory systems including the same, and

methods of calibrating multi-die impedance of the memory modules.

DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART
[0003] As the operating speed of semiconductor memory devices has increased, swing width of
signals interfaced between a semiconductor memory device and a memory controller has
generally decreased. However, as swing width has decreased, signals transferred between the
semiconductor memory device and the memory controller may be more easily distorted by
impedance mismatch caused by process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. An
impedance calibration operation for adjusting output impedance and/or a termination impedance
of the semiconductor memory device may be employed at transmitting and/or receiving stages of
the semiconductor memory device. The impedance calibration operation may be referred to as an

input/output (I/O) offset cancellation operation or a ZQ calibration operation.
