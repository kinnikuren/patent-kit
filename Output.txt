DETAILED ACTION

The present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being examined under the first
inventor to file provisions of the AIA.

In the event the determination of the status of the application as subject to AIA 35 U.S.C. 102
and 103 (or as subject to pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103) is incorrect, any correction of the
statutory basis for the rejection will not be considered a new ground of rejection if the prior
art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the rejection, would be the same under either

status.

Information Disclosure Statement

The information disclosure statement (IDS) submitted on 03/15/2018 is in compliance with
the provisions of 37 CFR 1.97. Accordingly, the information disclosure statement is being

considered by the examiner.

Low Power Double Data Rate 4 (LPDDR4) memory).

Regarding claim 16, this claim has substantially the same subject matter as that in

claim 1. Therefore, claim 16 is rejected under the same rationale as claim | above.

Tatapudi further teaches a method, wherein performing the impedance calibration
operation sequentially in each of the plurality of memory devices from the first memory

Allowable Subject Matter
6. Claims 3-12, 14, 19 are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but
would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the

base claim and any intervening claims.

The following is a statement of reasons for the indication of allowable subject matter:

Regarding claim 3, the prior arts fail to teach or reasonably suggest a memory

module comprising:

an impedance calibration circuit connected to the first reception pad, the first
transmission pad, the impedance pad, and the selection pad,

wherein the impedance calibration circuit comprises:

a detector connected to the selection pad, and configured to generate a detection
signal;

a command controller connected to the first reception pad and the first transmission
pad, wherein the command controller is configured to receive the impedance calibration
command from one of the first reception pad and a corresponding command decoder; and

a calibration circuit connected to the external resistor through the impedance pad,
20wherein the calibration circuit is configured to perform the impedance calibration
operation to output a pull-up control code and a pull-down control code to the output driver,
and is configured to provide the command controller with a first comparison signal and a
second comparison signal which indicate a completion of the impedance calibration

operation, in combination with the other limitations of the claim.Application/Control Number: 15/922,332 Page 9
Art Unit: 2844

Regarding claims 4-12, the claims 4-12 are objected due to their dependencies to

claim 3.

Regarding claim 14, this claim has substantially the same subject matter as that in

claim 3. Therefore, claim 14 is objected under the same rationale as claim 3 above.

Regarding claim 19, the prior arts fail to teach or reasonably suggest a method,

wherein performing the impedance calibration operation sequentially in each of the plurality
of memory devices from the first memory device further comprises: transferring, by the
second memory device, the impedance calibration command to the first memory device using
the ring topology, when the first memory device does not match with the second memory
device; performing, in the first memory device, the impedance calibration operation for the
first memory device, in response to the impedance calibration command performing, in each
of other memory devices which are not selected as the master, the impedance calibration
operation sequentially by receiving the impedance calibration command from the first
memory device or an adjacent memory device, in combination with the other limitations of

the claim.

Any comments considered necessary by applicant must be submitted no later than the
